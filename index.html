    My name is Jahmya and I am a rising junior at Abraham Lincoln High School. Child endangerment and abuse is very important to me because no child should have go through a trauma where they are being neglected or harmed and might be murdered. The children of the world are our future and child endangerment/abuse reduces the amount of future leaders and scientists that our future will one day need. Our world is already corrupt enough and everyday a child has to suffer due to a reckless parent/guardian or any other person who wants to destroy a childs life. I have created a list of the most important child endangerment/abuse sitiuations to inform my readers about the different ways their child or any other child can be endangered.
